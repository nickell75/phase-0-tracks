-----------In Action----------

Even after watching tutorials and read several different resources, there were still a few issues that I didn't understand until actually running the jquery in a js file.  Had problems making the elements behave the way that I wanted and had to fiddle around and look up specific terms in order to make it run the way I wanted.
