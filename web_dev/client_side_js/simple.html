		A Simple Project
	</h1>
	<p id ="first-paragraph">Create a simple project that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. This can be as simple as a script that changes the style of an element, or something much more complicated if you feel like delving deeper.</p>

	<p>A stretch goal might be figuring out how to create new HTML elements with JavaScript and add them to your page, or how to loop through a collection of nodes of a certain class and apply the same effect to all of them.) </p>

	<p>You don't have to do anything special to delay the DOM manipulation -- it can run right away.</p>
