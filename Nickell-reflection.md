What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	Fetch and merege were confusing at first but easy to understand after Guide explained it
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	Most questions concerned proper workflow steps, not doing one step before the previous, git add before git commit not git commit then git add
What still confuses you about Git?
	memorizing all the different commands and what they do, merge vs push fetch vs pull or clone
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	I was a little nervous at first, didnt know what to expect, but the over all experience was great, having another to help when I was stuck plus the guide incase neither of us knew the correct answer was great.
