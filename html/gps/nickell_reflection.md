What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Snippets could be useful if your going to be using the same code over and over again and rather than retyping all of it you could just use the snippet to save time. 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
For me the most difficult part was the arrangment of the table, mostly just trying to remember what goes where in terms of th, td and tr.  To improve my understanding i'll try to create tables more often to help memorize what goes where.
