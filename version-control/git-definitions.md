# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
		Version control records changes to a file so that you can come back to it specific, earlier, versions later. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
		A branch isolates a file for any updates, adding code or files, made by a user from the master that can then be reintroduced to the master branch at a later point, updating the old with the new.  This is useful because if any mistakes are made in the branch it wonâ€™t affect the master until they are merged.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
		A commit records changes made in a repository, a good commit message should be detailed highlighting the changes made since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
		Merge conflicts can occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.
